Which organisation was involved in its implementation?
The database was developed internally by the IT department. Editors and quality coordinators at local,
regional and national level are responsible for its quality and usability.
Only editors can upload a project for the relevant project manager. This ensures that all projects are
described within the given criteria. For example, editors can assess whether a project is innovative since
they have an overview of all the projects involved.
Quality coordinators develop the quality assurance so that they also check that projects in the database
meet the criteria set out in the guidelines and also monitor which office is working on which themes.
They are often also internal assessors who assess the performance of regional branches every three
years. They support the organisation to implement core concepts of the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM).
 Which groups were targeted by the practice?
Employees at all governance levels can search the database and managers and staff submit their projects via an editor.
Social partners working jointly on projects also have access to the database, but cannot submit a project.
